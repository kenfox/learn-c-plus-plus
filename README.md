C++ Robot Programming
=====================

FRC 2013 examples and tutorials for learning how to use C++ to program the robot.
Unfortunately the videos use Java. The FRC library for robot programming
is almost identical between Java and C++ so the videos are still useful--just don't
expect to type in the code exactly as shown.

If you don't know C++ see below for the section on general C++ programming.
