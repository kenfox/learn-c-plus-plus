C++ Robot Programming
=====================

FRC 2013 examples and tutorials for learning how to use C++ to program the robot.
Unfortunately the videos use Java. The FRC library for robot programming
is almost identical between Java and C++ so the videos are still useful--just don't
expect to type in the code exactly as shown.

If you don't know C++ see below for the section on general C++ programming.

Robot Builder and Command-based robots (multi-part watch in order):

2012 FRC C++ Documentation:

The 2013 documentation hasn't caught up completely with the 2012 material.
If you can't find information in the links above, try this, but watch out
for changes. Mainly bug fixes and improvements, but some SmartDashboard
and RobotBuilder has changed.
